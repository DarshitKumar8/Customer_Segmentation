## 1. Introduction
In todayâ€™s competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding customer behavior is crucial for developing effective marketing strategies. This project employs data analysis and clustering techniques to categorize customers into meaningful segments.

## 2. Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes customer demographic information, purchasing behavior, and other relevant features. It consists of the following columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `age`: Customer's age
- `gender`: Gender of the customer
- `income`: Customer's income
- `spending_score`: Score assigned based on customer spending behavior
- `membership_years`: Duration of membership with the platform
- `purchase_frequency`: Frequency of purchases
- `preferred_category`: Customer's preferred product category
- `last_purchase_amount`: Amount spent on the last purchase

## 3. Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Feature Engineering**: New features were created to capture customer behavior and demographics, such as age groups, income categories, and spending efficiency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization techniques were employed to understand the distribution of numerical features and the relationships between different variables.
4. **Clustering**: K-Means clustering was used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms were created to visualize the distribution of numeric features like age, income, and spending score.
- A correlation matrix was generated to identify relationships between different features, revealing potential insights for segmentation.

## 5. Customer Segmentation
- The K-Means clustering algorithm was applied to the scaled features.
- An optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method and silhouette scores.
- Customers were segmented into three clusters:
  - **Big Spenders**
  - **Occasional Spenders**
  - **Moderate Spenders**

## 6. Business Insights
- **Tailored Marketing Strategies**: Specific strategies were developed for each customer segment to enhance engagement and conversion rates.
- **Product Category Focus**: Recommendations on optimizing product offerings based on customer preferences.
- **Age-Related Strategies**: Marketing efforts tailored to different age groups to maximize engagement.
- **Loyalty Programs**: Suggestions for implementing loyalty programs to improve customer retention.

## 7. Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling the business to adopt more focused marketing strategies. Ongoing analysis and adjustments will be crucial for maintaining relevance in a dynamic market.
